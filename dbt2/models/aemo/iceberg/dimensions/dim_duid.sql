{#-- Insert-only merge on DUID, the same pattern as the facts: new DUIDs insert, existing ones
     are never touched — so a run that sees a stale or empty view of the table can at worst
     re-insert nothing that survives the merge, instead of the old wipe-and-reload appending a
     full duplicate copy. Consequence: attribute changes (region / fuel / geo) never update in
     place; `dbt run --full-refresh -s dim_duid` is the reconciliation lever. --#}
{#-- INSERT-ONLY MERGE, dbt 2 spelling. The other four engines say this as
     merge_clauses={'when_matched': [{'action': 'do_nothing'}]}. dbt 2 rejects that key
     outright at parse -- UnusedConfigKey (dbt1060), which is a HARD error in v2 and
     cannot be downgraded -- even though its own duckdb merge macro reads
     config.get('merge_clauses') and handles a do_nothing action. The key is simply
     absent from the config schema in 2.0.4.
     An always-false update condition is the documented key that survives validation and
     renders WHEN MATCHED AND false THEN UPDATE BY NAME -- a branch that never fires, so
     the commit carries appended data files and no delete files, which is what the
     OneLake catalog requires. Same semantics, same unique_key: matched rows are left
     exactly as they are and only new keys insert. --#}
