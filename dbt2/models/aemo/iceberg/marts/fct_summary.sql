-- Determinism contract: same inputs => same summary, on every engine, regardless of that
-- engine's run history. Every run emits the COMPLETE recomputation -- the same SQL as a full
-- refresh -- for exactly the dates whose stored content could still be stale, and the write
-- reconciles that batch key by key. A partial top-up would fossilize gaps forever.
--
-- This is the fct_summary of djouallah/direct-lake-parquet-layout, the design that got its
-- engines to the same row count, and it is the SAME logic in all five trees here. The
-- previous copy in this tree (a has-new-daily probe, an insert of missing keys only, and a
-- "skip dates with >= 280 intervals" crater filter) fossilised every date first written from
-- the intraday feed and never revisited it; parity measured it 1,911-3,244 rows short.
--
-- Insert-only on the DuckDB family, which is a real limitation and not a preference: the
-- OneLake Iceberg REST catalog rejects a matched-UPDATE branch (BadRequest 400), and the three
-- DuckDB trees run one config so duckrun and ducklake give up the update they could do.
-- Consequence: a re-emitted row carrying REVISED mw/price does NOT overwrite what is stored --
-- craters (missing keys) are repaired, changed values are not. spark and dwh do update, so a
-- revision would show up as a value difference between the engine pairs; the repair lever on
-- this side is a reset: drop the table and the next run recomputes it (--full-refresh fails
-- on the iceberg catalog: "fct_summary__dbt_tmp does not exist").
-- Not delete+insert on duckrun: that adapter implements it as a fenced full-table overwrite.
--
-- No merge path DELETES a row the recomputation stops producing, which is why dispatch_duids
-- below gates the intraday branch to units the daily branch can reproduce. Treat any edit to
-- dispatch_duids as load-bearing -- nothing catches a mistake in it except parity.
