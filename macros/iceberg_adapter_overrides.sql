{#--
    Adapter-level overrides for the ICEBERG target only.

    THE HAZARD THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND: `iceberg` and `ducklake` are BOTH `type: duckdb`.
    A `duckdb__` macro dispatches on ADAPTER TYPE, so anything defined here applies to the
    ducklake target too. (The direct-lake-parquet-layout repo this scheme is copied from had
    only ONE duckdb-type target, so it could override freely; we cannot.) Every macro here
    therefore branches on `target.name` and reproduces dbt-duckdb's own body verbatim for
    everyone else — and `tests/test_adapter_overrides.py` pins those fallback bodies against
    the INSTALLED adapter, so an upstream change fails loudly instead of leaving ducklake
    silently running a stale copy of dbt-duckdb's SQL.

    Reproduced from dbt-duckdb 1.11.0 (dbt/include/duckdb/macros/adapters.sql). Both
    overrides used to be much larger: dbt-duckdb has since upstreamed the DESCRIBE-instead-of-
    information_schema change and the no-CASCADE-for-DuckLake branch, so all that is left
    here is what is genuinely Iceberg-specific.
