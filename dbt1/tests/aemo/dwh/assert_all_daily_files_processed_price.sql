-- Rows returned = landed daily files the model has not folded into fct_price YET.
-- A WARNING, not a failure: with a process_limit smaller than the backlog an initial load
-- cannot fold everything, and what it did fold is correct -- just incomplete. Files are
-- selected NEWEST first on every engine, so a row here is older data still queued, and the
-- count falls run by run until it reaches zero. Investigate a count that STOPS falling, not
-- a count that is non-zero.
