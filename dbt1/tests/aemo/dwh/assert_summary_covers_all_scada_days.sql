-- The summary should hold at least as many distinct days as fct_scada.
-- A WARNING, not a failure, and for the same reason as the assert_all_*_files_processed_*
-- tests: with a small process_limit a date whose ingested files are all INTERVENTION=1 or carry
-- unmapped DUIDs produces zero summary rows and trips this until the backlog has converged.
-- Investigate a gap that STOPS closing, not a gap that exists.
