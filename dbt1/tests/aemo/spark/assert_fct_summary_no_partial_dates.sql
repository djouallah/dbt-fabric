-- Crater tripwire: a date that lands PARTIALLY in the summary and is then never completed.
-- Mechanism: during backfill a date enters the summary with only the intervals fct_scada
-- happened to hold at that moment (typically the 49 from the previous day's archive file);
-- the daily branch used to skip any date already present, so the rest of the day never
-- arrived. fct_summary now reprocesses dates it holds partially, which heals these -- this
-- test is the guard that it keeps working. Observed 2025-09-13: 49 in the summary, 288 in
-- fct_scada.
--
-- Compares against fct_scada, NOT against a fixed 288, because "short" and "wrong" are not
-- the same thing. A date can be short at the SOURCE: its first ~4h live in the PREVIOUS
-- day's archive file, so until the backfill loads that file the date sits legitimately
-- capped. fct_scada agrees with the summary on those, and flagging them is noise.
-- Do not re-derive this as "the previous day is missing, so the cap is permanent" -- it
-- usually is not; comparing against the source is what makes the distinction
-- self-correcting.
--
-- The 280 pre-filter is a cheap shortlist off fct_summary alone, not the assertion; only
-- those few dates are probed against fct_scada (measured: ~46s for 2 dates vs ~233s for a
-- full-year aggregate). The latest date is excluded -- it is legitimately still filling.
