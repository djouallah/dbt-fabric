{#-- Spark counterpart of new_source_files(): the csv FILENAMES (with extension) a fact model
     ingests THIS RUN, resolved from the archive log AT RUN TIME via run_query. The spark stage
     macros (spark_read_csv.sql) turn the list into an explicit Hadoop brace glob for the
     `USING csv OPTIONS (path ...)` temp view.

     The selection rule is IDENTICAL to the other dialects -- files of this source_type minus
     whatever {{ this }} already holds, oldest first, capped at process_limit -- so every engine
     folds the SAME files. process_limit is the same knob duckrun/iceberg/ducklake read in
     their pre_hooks and dwh reads in new_source_files; spark used to be the one engine without
     it, and its first build was a bare-folder scan of the whole archive.

     this_relation is none on a first build / --full-refresh (nothing is ingested yet, so
     every file of the type is new). Returns [] while parsing (execute=false). --#}
