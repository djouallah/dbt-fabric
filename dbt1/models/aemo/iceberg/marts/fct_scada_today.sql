{#-- Intraday DISPATCHSCADA: an 8-column record, landed every 5 minutes. Narrow enough that
     the reader types the columns directly rather than reading all-varchar and casting.

{#-- THE PRE-HOOK MUST STAY ONE STRING LITERAL, WITH ITS {{ }} AND {% %} UNEVALUATED.
     dbt renders hooks at RUN time, and only then are `ref()`, `this` and `is_incremental()`
     bound properly. Moving this into a `{%- set -%}` block instead renders it during dbt's
     CONFIG pass, where `ref()` is a stub that returns the MODEL'S OWN relation — the hook
     then silently reads from {{ this }} instead of the archive log, and the run fails with
     "Table with name <this model> does not exist". Verified the hard way. Only
     `source_type`, a parse-time constant, is concatenated in. --#}
{#-- ORDER BY archive_path DESC inside the pre-hook, i.e. NEWEST FIRST, and it is not
     cosmetic. archive_path is '/<subfolder>/PUBLIC_*_YYYYMMDD*.CSV', so lexicographic DESC is
     chronological. Two reasons, both learned:
       * A bare `LIMIT process_limit` with no ORDER BY -- which is what stood here -- lets
         DuckDB return ANY n of the backlog, and a different n per engine. dwh and spark order
         theirs (new_source_files.sql, spark_new_files.sql), so on a run with a small
         process_limit the five engines folded DIFFERENT FILES and parity.py graded them on
         different inputs, reporting that as a logic difference.
       * Newest first means a partial load is RECENT data. The backlog is then old data still
         queued, which converges over runs -- and the assert_all_*_files_processed_* tests say
         so as a WARNING rather than failing the build. --#}
